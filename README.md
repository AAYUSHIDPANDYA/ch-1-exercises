IN THIS PROJECT, CODES ARE WRITTEN IN C LANGUAGE FOR THE GIVEN TASK BELOW AND ALSO REFERENCE IS GIVEN ,i.e.,k&r BOOK.
FOLLOWING ARE EXERCISES THAT CAN BE DONE AFTER COMPLETION OF CHAPTER 1 AND ITS EXAMPLES FROM THE GIVEN BOOK...

4

Write a function Celsius_to_Fahrenheit and print ‘Celsius to Fahrenheit’ table for user provided range of Temperature (in Celsius).

5

Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0. (Reference Topic: 1.3)

6

Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1. (Reference page : 17 K&R)

7

Write a program to print the value of EOF. (Reference page : 17 K&R)

8

Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines. (Reference page : 20 K&R)

9

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank. (Reference page : 20 K&R)

10

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t , each backspace by \b , and each backslash by \\ . This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way. (Reference page : 20 K&R)

12

Write a program that prints its input one word per line. (Reference page : 21 K&R)
13

Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging. (Reference page : 24 K&R)
14

Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input. (Reference page : 24 K&R)
16

Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text. (Reference page : 28, 29, 30 K&R)
17

Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters. (Reference page : 28, 29, 30,31 K&R)
18

Write a program to remove all trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines. (Reference page : 28, 29, 30, 31 K&R)
19

Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s . Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time. (Reference page : 28, 29, 30, 31 K&R)
20

Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?
21

Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks with the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same stops as for detab . When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference?
22

Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n -th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.
23

Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments do not nest.




IN ACCORDANCE TO NUMBER ASSIGNED TO EXERCISE, CODES ARE WRITTEN WITHIN THAT FILE NO.
ALSO THE REFERENCE PAGE NO. IS GIVEN SO THAT IF WE HAVE DOUBT ,WE CAN REFER THE TEXT............
